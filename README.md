# sharedwallet

Produced during a hackathon at Ariel Communications as a concept proof of a tool to move funds between multiple accounts held in a trading platform. Each platform account could have an amount of free money which could be reallocated to other accounts. The UI allows you to reproportion the available funds then click Save to make the transfers between accounts.
